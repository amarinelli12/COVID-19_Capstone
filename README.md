# Capstone Project: COVID-19 Length of Stay (LOS) Predictor

## Technical Summary

## The Motivation

It goes without saying that the onset of the COVID-19 virus has had a drastic impact on the world as we know it today. At the beginning of the pandemic, hospitals were overrun with patients needing medical attention and it became clear that hospital infrastructure was not equipped for this unprecedented event.

The motivation for this project came from a conversation I had with my roommate who is a nurse here in San Francisco who worked on a COVID unit during the pandemic. She told me that one of the biggest factors leading to inadequate care was the lack of hospital resources. Without proper resources, sick people were not able to receieve proper care. One of major contributing factors to this came from not knowing how long a patient would be hospitalized for when they are admitted. With such a huge influx of long-term residential patients, hospitals were quickly drained of resources such as PPE, certain medications, and even beds themselves.
